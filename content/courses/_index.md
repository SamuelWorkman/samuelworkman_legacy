I specialize in public policy, the bureaucracy, and regulatory politics. I teach courses in public policy, agenda setting, regulatory policy, bureaucracy, and research methods. My courses emphasize bringing research into the classroom, open discussion, and critical thinking.

My courses on data analysis and statistical methods emphasize data-driven decision-making, visualizing data and statistical models, and intuitive presentation and communication of analysis to general and lay audiences. This page serves as the portal to official courses offered at the university as well as other instructional materials and vignettes.
