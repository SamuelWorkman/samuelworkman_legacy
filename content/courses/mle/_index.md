title: Maximum Likelihood Estimation
---

The vast majority of data of interest to social scientists do not fit into the Gaussian assumptions of the classic normal regression model taught in introductory statistics courses. Data often diverge drastically from the continuous, normally distributed outcomes associated with the classic model. Common data of interest display binary, ordinal, or nominal outcomes. In addition, data are often correlated across space, time, or are nested, making applications of the classic model difficult. More importantly, the application of the classic model to data of this type often leads to confusing, strained, or nonsensical interpretations of analyses. That is, the classic model applied to this data makes *substantive* interpretation of findings difficult---a major problem when communicating research findings in the academy or to policy makers charged with decision-making. This course will introduce the students to maximum likelihood methods that can be more broadly applied to social science data. Throughout, we will emphasize the communication of these models for substantive import of the findings and decision-making.
