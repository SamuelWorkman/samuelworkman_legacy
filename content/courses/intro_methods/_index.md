title: Introduction to Analysis of Political Data
---

This is an introductory course in data science for political scientists. As such, the course covers the collection and organization of data, issues associated with measurement, describing data quantitatively, and communicating features of data using statistical tables and graphics. We will discuss hypothesis-testing, statistical control, and descriptive inference, how to deal with categorical data, and how to measure association between two variables. The course provides the foundational knowledge needed to learn the the most common statistical estimator in the social sciences - least squares regression.

There are no specific prerequisites for this course, although familiarity with matrix algebra, probability, and working with exponents and logs is helpful. All needed math and coding will be demonstrated and covered in class. Students will implement the techniques from the course using freely available statistical programs. Students should also be ready to work with their own data.
