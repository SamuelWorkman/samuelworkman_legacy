## Course Description

This seminar assesses the role of the federal bureaucracy in American politics and policy implementation. The course addresses three major features of bureaucracy. The first of these are bureaucrats themselves. We will discuss street-level bureaucracy, the influences on bureaucratic behavior, and how bureaucrats cope with the crush of politics and public service. The second section focuses on bureaucratic politics and public policy. In particular we will address how bureaucracies make policy and implement public programs. The third section focuses on bureaucracies as organizations, paying particular attention to how information shapes public policy and decision-making in organizations of all types. Each weekâ€™s discussion will combine scholarship on theory development, conceptualization, and empirical tests, sometimes within distinct policy areas. The course operates in discussion format. Students will be expected to take the readings seriously and to engage the professor and their peers in discussing the readings for understanding and for their implications.
