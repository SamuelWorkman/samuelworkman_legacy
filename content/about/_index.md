title: About me
---

I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Political Science at *The* University *of* Oklahoma. I am also a research faculty member in the Center for Risk and Crisis Management. I am a political scientist working at the intersection of American politics, public policy, statistics, and data science. I research the bureaucracy, regulatory politics and policy, and how institutions and organizations search for, generate, and use information. My work typically emphasizes text-as-data, machine learning, and statistical modeling, especially classification, stochastic processes, and likelihood methods. Current academic projects examine congressional bureaucracies, the politics of numbers and measurement, the regulatory politics of education policy, and agenda-setting in food policy.

My teaching spans American politics, public policy, public administration, and research methods. My approach emphasizes an interactive classroom that brings research and data to bear in illustrating key concepts, theories, and characteristics of governing and policy systems. The goal is to help students the politics of these systems and reason through the tradeoffs and tensions inherent in governing systems, public policy, and within organizations.

I also provide statistical consulting in the private sector, specializing in the grocery floral category. My work focuses on data-driven decision-making and management, custom reporting, and data-informed programming. My projects have focused on market, inventory, and sales analysis, outlier detection and learning, customized dashboards and user interfaces. Email me to discuss your data and statistical needs.

I am a contributor at [*Towards Data Science*](https://towardsdatascience.com/), where I write on practical applications of data science and statistics. I am also one of the founding Editors of [*3Streams*](https://medium.com/3streams). In addition to editorial duty, I write on rural politics and policy, including Appalachia's politics. My popular writing on data science and rural politics has received over 10k views.

I am originally from Fayette County West Virginia. I enjoy rural life: mountains, rivers, fishing, gardens, and forests.
