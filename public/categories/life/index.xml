      <description>Like many in the academy, I am lucky.

      <description>Its almost time!! Spring break is coming, if COVID-19 doesn&amp;rsquo;t get here first.
Sheri and I are headed back to the mountains for spring break. Plans to plant additional apples and pears in the orchard, saw some lumber on the sawmill, and hike down to Gauley River from the family farm.</description>
