      <description>Like many in the academy, I am lucky. Since self-isolating beginning March 10, my family has lived out of our freezerâ€”chocked full of beef and pork (oddly no chicken, but more on that below). How our freezer is full, and its contents, are what lead me to this short dispatch. The convergence of the pandemic, my upbringing, and oddly, the geometry of coolers, have bent the arc of time and transported me to a simpler life I left long ago.</description>

      <description>So&amp;hellip;we never made it to West Virginia. I came home after work on March 8th and decided going back to the office was a bad idea. So, we have been self-isolating here in rural Oklahoma. I don&amp;rsquo;t teach in the Spring Semester so it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been too difficult.
Political signaling - the power of elites to dictate public response was on full display in my small rural community. Though me and mine locked ourselves down early, not much changed here for a while.</description>
