      <description>So&amp;hellip;we never made it to West Virginia. I came home after work on March 8th and decided going back to the office was a bad idea. So, we have been self-isolating here in rural Oklahoma. I don&amp;rsquo;t teach in the Spring Semester so it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been too difficult.
Political signaling - the power of elites to dictate public response was on full display in my small rural community. Though me and mine locked ourselves down early, not much changed here for a while.</description>
