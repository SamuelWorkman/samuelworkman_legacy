# Description

This is my personal website for acedemics & data and statistical consulting.

The site is based on the `hugo-future-imperfect-slim` theme as curated by `pacollins`. I have altered the fonts to use Google fonts "Philosopher" and "Fira". See `static/fonts` for example scss and the font files, which can be adjusted. Be sure to set `config.toml` variable `cssFiles` to `["default","/static/fonts/your.scss"].

Feel free to fork this site and adjust to suit your needs.

# To Do:

- [x] Create CV page.
- [x] Create current projects page.
- [ ] Create data page.
- [x] More tinkering with fonts.
- [ ] Try out math.
- [ ] Implement a light/dark theme.
